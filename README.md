1. In the landing screen, when users switch between the two time modes, both the track and the
   thumb of the switch change colors. This is to emphasize contrast between two modes. A message
   is toasted to remind users of their choices each time they switch;
   In LearnEasy screen, we change the visibility of a button to indicate that it is selected and
   allow users to change their selections freely before clicking the "CHECK" to check the result;
   For buttons at the bottom of the screen in Learn Mode, we use another color (blue) to 
   differentiate from that of the selection buttons;
   On HardResult screen we implement two buttons that allow users to retry or go back to the
   landing screen.

2. It does not make sense to have six (or more?) different activities for this simple version of 
   the app since some activities are similar and therefore can be combined.
